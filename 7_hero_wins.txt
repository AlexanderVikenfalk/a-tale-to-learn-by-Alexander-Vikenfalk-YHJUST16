The raft is close now. Our hero gathers strength to jump for his life. But then he just stands there. 

As he turns around the riders and the villain stands there. He won't run anymore. He will stay and a fight. He hears a familiar bark..It's his friends dog, Bob alongside with Luigi. 
Luigi attempts to scare the villian and bursts out in a vicous screech. . As the strangers come closer he sees that the riders and the villain are nothing more than friends wondering why he so suddenly ran away.
